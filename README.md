User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to see all of the messages that have been left in the guestbook

REQUIREMENTS

🎯 Create a page containing a form to leave a message and a list of all the messages that have been left.
🎯 Style the form and the messages so they're easy to read on multiple kinds of device.
🎯 Create an API POST route to accept the text from your message input form
🎯 Create a database to store the messages, and create a seed file to create the table
🎯 Create an API GET route to retrieve all the messages from the database
🎯 Fetch the messages from your API in the browser and display them on the page.

STRECH GOALS

🏹 Add a delete button to each message, that sends a request to the server to delete the message
🏹 Add a like button to each message, that sends a separate request to the server to increment the likes on the message

PLANNING

One page form to include:

Header - Guest boook
1: Subject
2: From
3: Message
4: stars 1 to 5?

My theme will be a ficticious hotel where guests can leave 1-5 star review, I want an image of the hotel.

After looking at several options I decided on the Overlook Hotel from the Shining, allowing me to create several fake reviews with actors names.

With this as my basis I decided to create my database schema and data first.
